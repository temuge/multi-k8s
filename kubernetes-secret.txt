Secret is an object just like deployment, pods in Kubernetes.
 
We created secret by applying the command:

kubectl create secret generic <secret_name> --from-literal key=value
                     (type of secret)


Instead of 'generic' secret, there are 2 other types of secrets:
- docker-registry
- tls -> is used for https setup
This can be verified in minikube by running:

kubectl get secrets

This is used in the ....-deployment.yaml files in the env variables like

-name: PGPASSWORD
 valueFrom:
 secretKeyRef:
    name: pgpassword
    key: PGPASSWORD


In production the "kubect create secret generic..." command is directly run on the
Google's command line tool.
